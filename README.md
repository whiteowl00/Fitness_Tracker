# Fitness_Tracker

## Description
In this Project, I create a workout tracker. This project requires me to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Installation
This application uses MongoDB for database and HEROKU for server.
MongoDB Atlas account and HEROKU are connected to each other.

## Usage
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
